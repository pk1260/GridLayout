      <h2>Drukhari</h2>
      <p>
        Ah the original Eldar, still holed up in the Webway,
        still all fucked up and loving pain.
        They’re a good counterpoint to the prim, stuck up Eldar,
        all living in their bone spaceships and fearing death.
        These Eldar treat everything differently, they’re slavers,
        pirates, experimenters with flesh.
        If only they didn’t look quite so emo, y’know?

      <h2>Chaos Daemons</h2>
      <p>
        Honestly I do love daemons in Warhammer 40k, I love them very much.
        So why aren’t they higher up? Because for every amazing daemony model,
        there’s one that isn’t quite so good. And even more than that,
        I feel that some of the daemon models don’t really ‘feel’ very much like
        their gods. Bloodletters for example, whilst useful, don’t feel
        hugely Khorne-y to me.

      <h2>Inquisition</h2>
      <p>
        The Imperium is beset by many enemies, both subtle and overt.
        The overt threats have armies to deal with them, but for the
        insidious threats which threaten the stability of humanity the
        Inquisition is there, blade, book, and bolter in hand.
        They’re a really brilliant fantasy, always rooting out heresy,
        xenos infections, and daemonic incursions. They’re the lone warrior
        deep in a hiveworld, uncovering secrets and putting enemies to fire
        and sword. Brilliant stuff.

      <p>
        The Imperium is beset by many enemies, both subtle and overt.

      <h2>Craftworlds</h2>
      <p>
        Alright, they’re dying out, they’re haughty, they’re prim,
        they call humans ‘mon-keigh’ which frankly is a joke that’s outstayed
        its welcome by several decades. But they’re just so damn cool.
        Those sleek lines on their Wraithlords, the Howling Banshees,
        the Exarchs, Warp Spiders! Every model is alien with a capital A,
        they’re space elves yes but they’re damned cool space elves.

      <h2>Space Marines</h2>
      <p>
        Space Marines are the main heroes of the Warhammer 40k universe,
        and for good reason. They’re humans but humans+, they get awesome armour,
        they get all the plot lines, and they’re diverse enough that you can
        make your own chapters and histories. Basically anything goes.
        So why aren’t they first? Well because their standard chapters,
        the existing ones, can be a bit up and down in lore, in theme,
        in colour schemes. For every Dark Angel there’s an Iron Hand,
        for every Salamander there’s an Ultramarine, for every Blood Angel
        there’s an Imperial Fist. And now I’ve offended probably every Space Marine player lets go on to…

      <h2>Chaos Space Marines</h2>
      <p>
        Space Marines but cooler. Also Word Bearers are Chaos Space Marines
        and they’re the best chapter in the game and Lorgar did nothing wrong
        and (That’s enough of that – Ed)

      <h2>Harlequins</h2>
      <p>
        Similar to my theory about Chaos Space Marines, Harlequins are Eldar…
        but cool. They’re a specialised smaller force of individual performers
        and warriors, and it’s that which makes them so unique and interesting
        in the universe. They flit through society, performing and undergoing
        missions, and you never really understand what their goals are.
        Most special amongst them all is the Solitaire, the figure representing
        death, something which rightfully terrifies all Eldar given that their
        souls are eaten by Slaanesh. Solitaire walks the battlefield, a lonely
        figure, unable to be hit by any mortal weapon until they reach their
        target and. Execute. Their plan. They’re beautiful, deadly, and the
        second best faction in the game.

      <h2>Orks</h2>
      <p>
        So who’s best? Who’s the number one? Orks. Why Orks? Is it their mockney
        accents? No. Is it their beliefs that can alter reality? No. Is it their
        tech? No. It’s that, out of all the races and species in the Warhammer
        Warhammer 40k universe, they’re the only ones that have won.
        A good day for an Ork is to wake up, and have a fight. A brilliant day
        is a day in which they have two fights. So this universe of Warhammer 40k,
        this grimdark far future, is a future of only war. So the Orks are
        consistently having the times of their lives. Doesn’t matter if they
        win or lose, they’re having a great time. They’re along for the ride,
        and the ride is fun.
